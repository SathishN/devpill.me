There are many different specializations within blockchain development, each requires a different set of skills, however a general understanding of distributed systems, basic cryptography, and knowing how smart contracts operate is required as a foundation for all of them. In this guide I'll try to provide a general overview of each of them as well as give the best guidance I can provide on the resources learners should prioritize and in which order they should take them. There are many roles that I'm not as familiarized with, so feel free to suggest pull requests with changes or DM with suggestions.
