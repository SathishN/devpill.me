We just released a new [social capital section](https://www.devpill.me/docs/social-capital/introduction/) in which readers can learn how to approach social platforms in order to grow and become better as developers. Contributions are welcome, just pop into the [devpill.me Discord](https://discord.gg/A376gXnmht), talk about what you want to add or simply submit a pull request to the [blockchain-development-guide](https://github.com/dcbuild3r/blockchain-development-guide) or [devpill.me](https://github.com/dcbuild3r/devpill.me) GitHub repos.
