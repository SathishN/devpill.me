Devpill.me is releasing the [Starknet developer guide](https://www.devpill.me/docs/starknet-development/introduction/) which has been made possible thanks to the support from StarkWare, [Gitcoin grants donors](https://gitcoin.co/grants/4975/devpillme-a-public-good-blockchain-development-gu) and the wider Starknet community! We are always looking to improve the content on devpill so feel free to provide feedback and suggestions on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/A376gXnmht)!
